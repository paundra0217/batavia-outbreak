## 🔴About
**Batavia Outbreak [WIP]** is a 3D top down shooter game which tells about a survivor who's exploring a place in which were swarmed by infectious creatures. Your task is to shoot down all zombies while trying to survive and explore places that were infected.

Indonesia during the final stages of World War II, in 1945, when Japanese forces are still occupying the region. The game takes place primarily around the city of Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), A secretive Japanese biological warfare unit, Unit 731, has been conducting experiments on bioweapons in the area. Disaster strikes when a military transport plane carrying a deadly bio-weapon crashes in the dense forests near Batavia. The bioweapon is a virulent pathogen designed to incapacitate enemy forces, but upon exposure to the local population, it has an unforeseen effect: it turns those infected into aggressive, mindless creatures.

This includes scripting the game mechanics, user interfaces, and level design. I am actively working on game mechanics including the player's action, enemies and it's behaviour, weapon system, as well as the level and some UI elements, which will significantly enhance the gameplay experience. Through continuous testing and optimization, I strive to deliver a polished and engaging game.
